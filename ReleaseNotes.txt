6) CME 2 is now able to communicate via EtherCAT (currently the only drives that
   support this are the AEP and XEL). WinPcap, a third-party driver, is required
   for EtherCAT communications.  The driver can be downloaded from Copley's web
   site:
       http://www.copleycontrols.com/motion/zip/WinPcap.zip

7) Added functionality in the PWM Config screen to set PWM deadband in velocity

   all 32 registers to flash.

10) Detailed encoder error information can now be read in the Error Log screen
    when there is a feedback error.  This only applies to the serial encoders
    that report the detailed information.

11) PWM Position is now available on the 8367 processor family.  This can be set 
    up in the Digital Position Screen.

================================================================================
  Features Added Since V5.0
================================================================================
1) Support for the new ADP amplifier has been added.

2) The Oscilloscope now has cursors to measure and analyze the waveforms
   displayed. The cursors can be found on the measurement tab on the Oscilloscope.

3) A high speed digital input can now be configured with the high speed position 
   capture function.  This feature requires a firmware version of at least 5.12
   (0.40 for XSJ and XTL).

4) Adjustable position wrap has been added for the XSJ and XTL products.  This
   feature needs a firmware version of at least 0.42.

5) Estimated sinusoidal commutation can now be chosen in the Basic Setup screen.
   This feature requires a firmware version of at least 4.70 (0.58 for XSJ and 
   XTL).

6) Functionality was added for MACRO amplifiers only, to save the tuning and
   setup parameters in a format that can be read by a Delta Tau controller. A
   firmware version of at least 1.02 is required for this feature.

7) Support for the new XSJ-R amplifier has been added.

8) When exiting the Network Configuration screen, you now have the option of
   resetting the amplifier, so that the amplifier can recognize the new settings.

9) A new screen has been added to configure Gain Scheduling.  This feature is
   only available on the XTL, XSJ, ADP, AMP, and AEP amplifiers and requires a
   firmware version of at least 1.10.

10) An Indexer program can now be configured to run on startup without the need
    for a go command.

11) Support has been added for the STX amplifier.

12) Home to hard stop can now be chosen as a homing method for a Stepnet amplifier.

================================================================================
    Installation procedures
================================================================================

The CD-ROM containing the software should automatically start the 
installation wizard when the disk is inserted into your CD-ROM drive.  If 
this does not happen automatically, run the program "setup.exe" from the 
CD-ROM.

We recommend running version 5.22 or later of the Xenus/Accelnet/Stepnet
firmware, and version 3.50 or later of the Accelus/Junus firmware.  The 
firmware can be obtained from our website: www.copleycontrols.com.  Use the
Download Firmware command on the Tools menu of CME 2 to update the firmware.



================================================================================
    User documentation
================================================================================

Using CME 2 guides are available in .pdf format on the CD-ROM and will be 
automatically placed in the  "Program Files\Copley Motion\CME 2\Doc" folder 
during the installation.  A shortcut to this folder will be placed on your 
desktop during the installation.  The documents are also available on our 
website:

www.copleycontrols.com.
